Skin_Data Rproject is a simulation framework to implement the newly introduced model free approach for the OSMAC sub-sampling method over the Skin Segmentation Data for the logistic regression model.

The main effects model includes two variables and rest of the models include every possible combination of the covariates squared term including the intercept.
