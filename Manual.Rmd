# 1. Overview

* The project ***"Skin Data"*** or ***"RS_OS_MROS_LR_RWS_SkinData"*** is developed for the purpose fitting multiple models estimated model parameters of the logistic regression model can be compared through the obtained informative samples from the Big Data using optimal sub-sampling and model robust optimal sub-sampling methods.

* This document aims to state every important part of this R project thoroughly in terms of folder structure related to used sub-sampling methods. 

# 2. Folder structure

* The sub-sampling methods applied in this study are 
1. Random Sampling, 
2. Rare event random sampling, 
3. Optimal Sub-sampling (OSMAC), and
4. Model Robust Optimal Sub-sampling (OSMAC_MF or OSMAC Model Free).

* A detailed description of all methods are explained in the Figure below.

![](Images/All Methods Figure.png)

* Simulations are repeated ***Replicates*** times such that at each replicate only ***Subsample_Size*** data points are extracted from the Big Data set of ***N*** observations. It is necessary to have replications so that we can evaluate the methods through MSE of the estimated model parameters.  

* The results from this simulation setup are stored in a such way that they could be summarised through Rmarkdown files for individual or grouped assessment for the above mentioned methods.

* In optimal sub-sampling and model robust optimal sub-sampling an initial sub-sample of **r0** observations are used to estimate the model parameters of a given model. From these parameters only the sub-sampling probabilities are calculated. Therefore, to compare optimal sub-sampling with model robust optimal sub-sampling there are two options; 1). Identical **r0** and 2). Non-Identical **r0**.

* Hence, **Identical_r0** can be used for method comparison and **Non_Identical_r0** can be used for application purposes.

## 2.1 Generated_Big_Data

![](Images/Generate_Big_Data.png)

* Generate and store Big Data.

* Using **Load_Data.R** and based on the **Q** models of the logistic regression create ***Scaled.RData***.

* In the Rscript, ***Replicates*** - number of unique simulations, ***Subsample_Size*** - target sample size, ***N*** - Big data size, ***Theta*** - Real model parameters, ***r0*** - initial sample size for optimal and model robust optimal sub-sampling.

* As of now the models are based on the covariates $x_1,x_2,x_3$ and their respective squared terms making **Q=8**.

## 2.2 Simulation_Setup

* Contains the simulation setup for the above mentioned subsampling methods based on the variety of models for the Big data and Rscripts to smoothly transfer methods and respective data.
